SolrNet 0.3.0
Solr client for .NET
http://code.google.com/p/solrnet/

This release is built against:
Castle Windsor 2.5.2
Ninject 2.1.0.76
StructureMap 2.6.1
NHibernate 2.1.2

If you use the built-in container, you'll need Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll
If you use SolrNet with the Windsor integration, you'll need Windsor binaries instead.
and so on.

The "unmerged" directory in the release package contains the unmerged assemblies in case you want more control.
The unmerged SolrNet.dll can run on .NET 2.0 (or higher, of course)
